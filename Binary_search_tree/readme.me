# Student Management System

This project is designed to create a system for managing a group of students at UFC - Campus Russas. Each student's data includes the following:

1. Student ID (Matr√≠cula)
2. Additional personal information as needed (e.g., name, email, address, phone, etc.)
3. An array containing course data. Each element in the array holds information about a course completed by the student, including course code, course name, and final grade.

The system is expected to provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a Student**: Add a student's data to a Binary Search Tree, using the student's ID as the unique key for insertion.

2. **Remove a Student**: Remove a student from the Binary Search Tree by providing their student ID.

3. **Modify Student Data**: Update a student's personal data. Given a student's ID, locate the corresponding node in the Binary Search Tree, inquire which personal data field requires modification, and request the new value for the update. Note that this function allows only changes to the student's personal data.

4. **Retrieve Student Data**: Given a student's ID, locate the corresponding node in the Binary Search Tree and present the student's personal data, along with the list of courses and their final grades. The courses and grades should be displayed in descending order of grades, necessitating the use of a sorting algorithm to order the array before printing it.
